                <h3>My Background</h3>
                <p>Salutations! If you have found your way here I'd wager you're either a potential employer or an intrigued classmate(of course there's always the third scenario, albeit much less likely to happen; you've somehow managed to string together the perfect combination of keywords in a search engine and ended up on my site). In any case, welcome! I've worked in the security field for the past six years, and while it has its perks, it isn't a career. With that pill bitterly swallowed, I finally decided to learn how to program in 2022. This undertaking has been something I've dreamt about since a young age when I would find myself constantly questioning how video games worked or how a computer was able to...well...compute. As it turned out, the answer is people! So here I am.</p></td>
